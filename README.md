# United States Broadband Availability - Availability Classification for October 2020
## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the availability and usage of broadband internet across U.S. counties as of October 2020. By exploring broadband distribution patterns and modeling classification based on availability, we gain insights into regional connectivity disparities and identify areas with limited access. The project leverages machine learning techniques to classify broadband availability into high, medium, and low categories based on data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

## Dataset Description
The dataset, sourced from the FCC, provides county-level broadband metrics, including the percentage of broadband availability and usage per county across the United States. Each record includes identifiers like county and state names, making it suitable for both regional analysis and aggregate modeling. Key fields include broadband availability, broadband usage, county identifiers, and state identifiers.
